# Introduction 
This project is a first attempt at digitizing sacred spaces in VR. The application features Islam and Christianity and provides several spaces to explore these two religions. Users can freely learn about the religion in general or experience a specific part of the religion. Currently users can either explore a holy mass inside a church or follow the journey of the pilgrims during Hajj, Islam's yearly pilgrimage to Mecca.
